Changelog_android
This is the changelog for the Android version. 
The app is still in a very early phase, so bug fixes and feature implementations are done at irregular intervals. 
This means that you should check this changelog before submiting an issue/bug, since it might already have been fixed.

                                  settings instead of the debt-view when clicking on "Debts" 
                                  (Commit: https://github.com/stianwe/DebtList/commit/224392fbbf811c6cee17910483838e2de493e316 ).
