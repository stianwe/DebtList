Changelog_android
This is the changelog for the Android version. 
The app is still in a very early phase, so bug fixes and feature implementations are done at irregular intervals. 
This means that you should check this changelog before submiting an issue/bug, since it might already have been fixed. 

DebtList_android_TEST_160613_2:   The update/notification system was fixed and re-activated. Should hopefully be working now!
                                  (Commit: https://github.com/stianwe/DebtList/commit/fdf7d5f2bf315fc39c318ebae09d667a9103eb12 ).
DebtList_android_TEST_160613:     Fixed bug with session system. This should fix the bugged friend request system aswell.
                                  Note: Database was rolled back (only users are still saved)!
                                  Note2: The polling for updates service is currently disabled. Time between updates
                                  can therefore be set to 0 (disabled) from the settings menu to improve battery life.
                                  This service is under revision, and will hopefully be back soon!

DebtList_android_TEST_140613_2:   Fixed bug in the navigation menu at the Friends-view, that took the user to 
                                  settings instead of the debt-view when clicking on "Debts" 
                                  (Commit: https://github.com/stianwe/DebtList/commit/224392fbbf811c6cee17910483838e2de493e316 ).
