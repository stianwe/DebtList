Changelog_android
This is the changelog for the Android version. 
The app is still in a very early phase, so bug fixes and feature implementations are done at irregular intervals. 
This means that you should check this changelog before submiting an issue/bug, since it might already have been fixed. 

v0.0.0.2_pre-release:             Fixed a bug that caused some debts that was merged together to still show for some users.
v0.0.0.1_pre-release:             The database now uses a user's ID instead of the user name as foreign keys.
                                  The issue with the Android application sometimes crashing for no reason when running in
                                  the background should now be fixed. The problem was that it was using a regular thread
                                  to do the polling for updates. This has been attempted fixed by using the AlarmManager
                                  to time the updates, and using a IntentService to do the polling when the application
                                  runs in the background.
                                  A bug that caused some users to see the login view when resuming the app, even if the
                                  user is already logged in, should now be fixed.
v0.0.0.0_pre-release:             Re-make versioning system (see wiki for more information). You will now receive a warning
                                  if you're using an outdated version, and not be able to log in if your version is no
                                  longer compatible with the current one.
                                  Bug with debts not disapearing after both users has completed is has now been corrected.
DebtList_android_TEST_170613:     Fixed bugs regarding accepting/declining friend requests, and creating debts.
                                  Note: Friends and friend requests has ben reseted.
DebtList_android_TEST_160613_2:   The update/notification system was fixed and re-activated. Should hopefully be working now!
DebtList_android_TEST_160613:     Fixed bug with session system. This should fix the bugged friend request system as well.
                                  Note: Database was rolled back (only users are still saved)!
                                  Note2: The polling for updates service is currently disabled. Time between updates
                                  can therefore be set to 0 (disabled) from the settings menu to improve battery life.
                                  This service is under revision, and will hopefully be back soon!
DebtList_android_TEST_140613_2:   Fixed bug in the navigation menu at the Friends-view, that took the user to 
                                  settings instead of the debt-view when clicking on "Debts" 
DetbList_android_TEST_140613:     First test version released
