Changelog_android
This is the changelog for the Android version. 
The app is still in a very early phase, so bug fixes and feature implementations are done at irregular intervals. 
This means that you should check this changelog before submiting an issue/bug, since it might already have been fixed. 

v0.0.0.0_pre-release:             Re-make versioning system (see wiki for more information). You will now receive a warning
                                  if you're using an outdated version, and not be able to log in if your version is no
                                  longer compatible with the current one.
                                  Bug with debts not disapearing after both users has completed is has now been corrected.

                                  Note2: The polling for updates service is currently disabled. Time between updates
                                  can therefore be set to 0 (disabled) from the settings menu to improve battery life.
                                  This service is under revision, and will hopefully be back soon!
